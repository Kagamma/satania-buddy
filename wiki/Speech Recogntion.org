This page documents various speech recognition backends supported (or previously supported) by ~satania-buddy~.

** Vosk
- This is the default speech recognition backend. It is accurate, very fast, and consumes few resources.

** whisper.cpp
- An experimental speech recognition backend, based on [[https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/][whisper.cpp]]. There're some disadvantages compared to ~Vosk~
  + It does not support streaming mode, so real-time STT requires some tricks at satania-buddy's end. The current implementation is not really good and limit the maximum speech buffer to 8 seconds only.
  + It requires a lot of processing power compared to ~Vosk~.

** Microsoft Speech Object Library
- A legacy speech recognition backend. Supports Windows only.

** CMU Sphinx
- An obsolete speech recognition backend, it was removed in favor of ~Vosk~.
