** Introduction

External Services allows satania-buddy to send and receive messages to 3rd party services. External services can be added by creating new Evil Script in ~data/scripts/<character>/services~. These scripts can access chat messages via either ~chat_history_get()~, or ~chat_message~. Some example scripts can be found in:
- ~data/scripts/satania/services/WolframAlpha.evil~ (WolframAlpha integration)
- ~data/scripts/satania/services/ChatGPT.evil~ (ChatGPT integration)
- ~data/scripts/satania/services/koboldcpp.evil~ (koboldcpp integration)

You can switch between these services in Chat window.
