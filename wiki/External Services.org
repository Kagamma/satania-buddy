** Introduction

External Services allows satania-buddy to send and receive messages to 3rd party services. External services can be added by creating new Evil Script in ~data/scripts/<character>/services~. These scripts can access chat messages via either ~chat_history_get()~, or ~chat_message()~. Some example scripts can be found in:
- ~data/scripts/satania (bloomers)/services/WolframAlpha.evil~ (WolframAlpha integration)
- ~data/scripts/satania (bloomers)/services/ChatGPT.evil~ (ChatGPT integration)
- ~data/scripts/satania (bloomers)/services/koboldcpp.evil~ (koboldcpp integration)
- ~data/scripts/satania (bloomers)/services/koboldcpp (programmer).evil~ (koboldcpp integration, focus on programming tasks)
- ~data/scripts/satania (bloomers)/services/oobabooga.evil~ (oobabooga's text-generation-webui integration)

You can switch between these services in Chat window.
