** Q & A
***** Q: Overall system requirements?
A:
- CPU: Any decent x86_64 CPU should be able to run. I personally run it on an i7-6700HQ and it barely reach 1% CPU usage (around 2% - 3% with Speech Recognition enable).
- RAM: The app consumes 100MB without Speech Recognition enable, and 300MB with Speech Recognition enable.
- GPU: Any decent intel iGPU with support for OpenGL 1.4 should be enough to run the app.

***** Q: Windows requirements?
A: Windows Vista or above with Aero enabled.

***** Q: Linux requirements?
A: x11, qt5, qt5pas, freetype, openssl, openal, vorbis

Optional dependencies: sensors

You also need a compositor, or else the app will show black screen.

***** Q: Why X11? Where's wayland support?
A: Wayland's "security" measurements makes this kind of software impossible to develop. Things you just can't do in wayland:
- Ability to manually control Satania's position on screen. This is needed if we want to drag her around, move her to other monitors/virtual desktops, or put her onto other windows.
- Can't access to other applications's window position (so no ~Sit On Window~).
- Can we even be able to tell wayland to make Satania's window always stay on top of everything else?

***** Q: OS X support when
A:[[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7451778/155552903-936f2ff1-a32b-4fe2-bbbd-0403d169808a.gif]]

(Joking aside OS X has a much higher chance to get ported over compare to Linux's wayland)/

***** Q: Privacy?
A: Satania Buddy works completely offline without any connections to remote servers.

***** Q: Scripting API?
A: https://github.com/Kagamma/satania-buddy/wiki/Scripting-Reference

***** Q: Chat features?
A: Type ~>app_name~ to execute external applications, for example: ~>echo Hello~

Type an expression, for example ~5+3*2~ and she will answer with ~11~

By default she has a simple rule-based chat system, you can configure patterns and responses in =Rules=, then tell her to learn the rules by pressing the =Learn= button.

If none of the above apply, then she will send your messages to https://www.wolframalpha.com/ for potential answers. Make sure to set your own AppID in =Chatbot > WolframAlpha=.

***** Q: How can I change her size?
A: ~Base Scaling~ in ~Settings~.

***** Q: How can I make her stay silent?
A: ~Silent~ menu.

***** Q: Why don't you contribute to existing satania-buddy projects instead of creating new one?
A: I suck at C/Rust/whatever shiny, "modern" programming languages out there. I also suck at pixel arts.

***** Q: Uoooooooohhh?
A: Uoooooooohhh?
